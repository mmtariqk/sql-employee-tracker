# SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker

In this application, we can perform full-fledged CRUD operations, because we can create/add, read/view, update and delete/remove employees from mysql database using terminal. So, a business owner can generate and retrieve team data records easily from this app. The application is using seed.sql file for integrating mock data into the database as well as defined schema. Command line interface is using for getting user input to make an action, such as viewing employees, viewing their departments, salary and adding and deleting an employee and to get the input needed to perform that action such as, getting the employee name and role etc.
